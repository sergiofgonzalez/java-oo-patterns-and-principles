> Decoupling creation of objects from the classes that use them

## Projects

### 001-pizzaparlor-v0
We need to design the domain model for pizza parlor preparation and ordering system. This is the first take on the design and implementation.

### 002-pizzaparlor-v1
The second take on the design and implementation using the *Simple Factory* idiom, which encapsulates object creation in a separate class.

### 003-pizzaparlor-v2
New requirements are added to the application to support local varieties. Inheritance is used to differentiate what changes from what stays the same.

### 004-pizzaparlor-v3
Some refactoring is added to the application to give franchises total control on how they handle object instantiation.

### 005-pizzaparlor-v4
Refactored using the Factory Method pattern.

### 006-pizzaparlor-v5
Adding new requirements to support families of ingredients so that local franchises can modify the standard behavior. This is achieved using the Abstract Factory pattern.
