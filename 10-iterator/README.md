## Projects

### 001-mixing-menu-implementations-v0
Illustrates how to implement several methods defined on two collections that are implemented using two different data structures.

### 002-mixing-menu-implementations-v1
Illustrates how you can use a custom *Iterator* interface to reduce the code duplication and complexity on an application which implements several methods defined on two collections that are implemented using two different data structures.

### 003-mixing-menu-implementations-v2
The same example, but using Java's own `Iterator`.

### 004-mixing-menu-implementations-v3
A new data structure is added to the mix. The example illustrate how easy it is to include support for that one thanks to the *Iterator* pattern.
