> adjusting a class to meet a completely different target interface

## Application Requirements
Implement an adapter for the Iterator interface for Enumeration instances.


## Proposed Design
Use the *Adapter* pattern to create a class that implements the target interface.


## Design Review
The *Adapter* satisfies the requirements.


## Principles and Patterns

### The Adapter Pattern
The *Adapter Pattern* converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
