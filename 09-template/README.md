> enabling classes to hook functionality right into an encapsulated algorithm

## Projects

### 001-beverage-preparation-template-v0
Implements two classes that represents the algorithms to prepare coffee and tea. The idea of this first version is to see what parts are common and what parts are different so that some generalization could be addressed in subsequent implementations.

### 002-beverage-preparation-template-v1
Illustrate how to use the *Template Method* pattern to protect and generalize the algorithm needed to prepare a beverage. The Template Method is implemented in the `BeveragePreparationAlgorithm`.

### 003-beverage-preparation-template-v2
Illustrate how to use the *Template Method* including hooks that subclasses can use to hook-in optional functionality.
